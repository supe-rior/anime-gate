        <p>One piece</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Summary:Gold Roger was known as the "Pirate King," the strongest 
                and most infamous being to have sailed the Grand Line. The capture 
                and execution of Roger by the World Government brought a change 
                throughout the world. His last words before his death revealed the 
                existence of the greatest treasure in the world, One Piece. It was 
                this revelation that brought about the Grand Age of Pirates, men who 
                dreamed of finding One Piece—which promises an unlimited amount of 
                riches and fame—and quite possibly the pinnacle of glory and the title 
                of the Pirate King. Enter Monkey Luffy, a 17-year-old boy who defies 
                your standard definition of a pirate. Rather than the popular persona 
                of a wicked, hardened, toothless pirate ransacking villages for fun, 
                Luffy's reason for being a pirate is one of pure wonder: the thought 
                of an exciting adventure that leads him to intriguing people and ultimately, 
                the promised treasure. Following in the footsteps of his childhood hero, 
                Luffy and his crew travel across the Grand Line, experiencing crazy 
                adventures, unveiling dark mysteries and battling strong enemies, all 
                in order to reach the most coveted of all fortunes—One Piece.</li>

                family has fallen upon Tanjirou Kamado's shoulders. Though living impoverished 
                on a remote mountain, the Kamado family are able to enjoy a relatively peaceful
                and happy life. One day, Tanjirou decides to go down to the local village to 
                make a little money selling charcoal. On his way back, night falls, forcing 
                Tanjirou to take shelter in the house of a strange man, who warns him of the 
                existence of flesh-eating demons that lurk in the woods at night. When he finally 
                arrives back home the next day, he is met with a horrifying sight—his whole 
                family has been slaughtered. Worse still, the sole survivor is his sister Nezuko, 
                who has been turned into a bloodthirsty demon. Consumed by rage and hatred, 
                Tanjirou swears to avenge his family and stay by his only remaining sibling. 
                Alongside the mysterious group calling themselves the Demon Slayer Corps, 
                Tanjirou will do whatever it takes to slay the demons and protect the remnants 
                of his beloved sister's humanity.</li>

                high schooler Yuuji Itadori spends his days at either the clubroom or the hospital, 
                where he visits his bedridden grandfather. However, this leisurely lifestyle 
                soon takes a turn for the strange when he unknowingly encounters a cursed item. 
                Triggering a chain of supernatural occurrences, Yuuji finds himself suddenly 
                thrust into the world of Curses—dreadful beings formed from human malice and 
                negativity—after swallowing the said item, revealed to be a finger belonging 
                to the demon Sukuna Ryoumen, the "King of Curses." Yuuji experiences first-hand 
                the threat these Curses pose to society as he discovers his own newfound powers.

            <li>Summary:Young Thorfinn grew up listening to the stories of old sailors that had 
                traveled the ocean and reached the place of legend, Vinland. It's said to be 
                warm and fertile, a place where there would be no need for fighting—not at all 
                like the frozen village in Iceland where he was born, and certainly not like 
                his current life as a mercenary. War is his home now. Though his father once 
                told him, "You have no enemies, nobody does. There is nobody who it's okay to 
                hurt," as he grew, Thorfinn knew that nothing was further from the truth. 
                The war between England and the Danes grows worse with each passing year. 
                Death has become commonplace, and the viking mercenaries are loving every 
                moment of it. Allying with either side will cause a massive swing in the balance 
                of power, and the vikings are happy to make names for themselves and take any 
                spoils they earn along the way. Among the chaos, Thorfinn must take his revenge 
                and kill Askeladd, the man who murdered his father. The only paradise for the 
                vikings, it seems, is the era of war and death that rages on.</li>

        <p>Classroom of the elite</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Summary:On the surface, Koudo Ikusei Senior High School is a utopia. The students 
                enjoy an unparalleled amount of freedom, and it is ranked highly in Japan. However, 
                the reality is less than ideal. Four classes, A through D, are ranked in order of 
                merit, and only the top classes receive favorable treatment. Kiyotaka Ayanokouji 
                is a student of Class D, where the school dumps its worst. There he meets the 
                unsociable Suzune Horikita, who believes she was placed in Class D by mistake and 
                desires to climb all the way to Class A, and the seemingly amicable class idol 
                Kikyou Kushida, whose aim is to make as many friends as possible. While class 
                membership is permanent, class rankings are not; students in lower ranked classes 
                can rise in rankings if they score better than those in the top ones. Additionally, 
                in Class D, there are no bars on what methods can be used to get ahead. In this 
                cutthroat school, can they prevail against the odds and reach the top? </li>

            <li>Summary:On the surface, the thought of Kyouko Hori and Izumi Miyamura getting along 
                would be the last thing in people's minds. After all, Hori has a perfect combination 
                of beauty and brains, while Miyamura appears meek and distant to his fellow classmates. 
                However, a fateful meeting between the two lays both of their hidden selves bare. 
                Even though she is popular at school, Hori has little time to socialize with her friends 
                due to housework. On the other hand, Miyamura lives under the noses of his peers, his 
                body bearing secret tattoos and piercings that make him look like a gentle delinquent. 
                Having opposite personalities yet sharing odd similarities, the two quickly become 
                friends and often spend time together in Hori's home. As they both emerge from their 
                shells, they share with each other a side of themselves concealed from the outside world.</li>

        <p>Frieren: Beyond Journey's End</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Summary:During their decade-long quest to defeat the Demon King, the members of the hero's 
                party—Himmel himself, the priest Heiter, the dwarf warrior Eisen, and the elven mage Frieren—forge 
                bonds through adventures and battles, creating unforgettable precious memories for most of them. 
                However, the time that Frieren spends with her comrades is equivalent to merely a fraction of 
                her life, which has lasted over a thousand years. When the party disbands after their victory, 
                Frieren casually returns to her "usual" routine of collecting spells across the continent. Due 
                to her different sense of time, she seemingly holds no strong feelings toward the experiences 
                she went through. As the years pass, Frieren gradually realizes how her days in the hero's party 
                truly impacted her. Witnessing the deaths of two of her former companions, Frieren begins to 
                regret having taken their presence for granted; she vows to better understand humans and create 
                real personal connections. Although the story of that once memorable journey has long ended, a 
                new tale is about to begin. </li>

                life and hides her extensive knowledge of medicine in order to avoid any unwanted attention. 
                Not long after Maomao's arrival, the emperor's infant children inexplicably begin to experience 
                grave symptoms—almost as if a curse has been cast. The curious Maomao easily solves the mystery

                dashing and perceptive eunuch Jinshi sees through it and manages to single her out. In recognition 
                of her talent, Maomao is promoted to lady-in-waiting for the emperor's favorite concubine, Gyokuyou. 
                As Maomao continues to remedy the numerous ailments afflicting the imperial court, her pharmaceutical

            <li>Summary:The Republic of San Magnolia. For a long time, this country has been besieged 
                by its neighbor, the Giadian Empire, which created a series of unmanned drones called 
                the Legion. After years of painstaking research, the Republic finally developed 
                autonomous drones of their own, turning the one-sided struggle into a war without 
                casualties—or at least, that's what the government claims. In truth, there is no such 
                thing as a bloodless war. Beyond the fortified walls protecting the eighty-five 
                Republic territories lies the "nonexistent" Eighty-Sixth Sector. The young men and 
                women of this forsaken land are branded the Eighty-Six and, stripped of their humanity, 
                pilot the "unmanned" weapons into battle... Shinn directs the actions of a detachment

                detachment from the remote rear with the help of special communication. The farewell
