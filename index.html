    <h3>My Hero Academia final season</h3>
    <p>The appearance of "quirks," newly discovered super powers, 
        has been steadily increasing over the years, with 80 percent of 
        humanity possessing various abilities from manipulation of elements 
        to shapeshifting. This leaves the remainder of the world completely 
        powerless, and Izuku Midoriya is one such individual. Since he was 
        a child, the ambitious middle schooler has wanted nothing more than 
        to be a hero. Izuku's unfair fate leaves him admiring heroes and 
        taking notes on them whenever he can. But it seems that his persistence 
        has borne some fruit: Izuku meets the number one hero and his personal 
        idol, All Might. All Might's quirk is a unique ability that can be inherited, 
        and he has chosen Izuku to be his successor! Enduring many months of grueling 
        training, Izuku enrolls in UA High, a prestigious high school famous for its 
        excellent hero training program, and this year's freshmen look especially 
        promising. With his bizarre but talented classmates and the looming threat 
        of a villainous organization, Izuku will soon learn what it really means to be a hero.</p>

    <h3>The Banished Court Magician Aims to Become the Strongest</h3>
    <p>This party doesn't need an incompetent magician who can only use supportive magic. 
        You're fired, Alec Ygret." Suddenly, Alec, a court magician who had joined the crown 
        prince's party to help him conquer dungeons—was banished from the party. And not just 
        the party, but the crown prince's harassment has banished him from the royal palace as 
        well, and a friend from the "magic academy" approached Alec, who was at his wit's end. 
        "Hey, Alec. Do you want to try to conquer the dungeon with us again?" And so, together 
        with the friends he used to party with, Alec begins his second journey in life. This 
        is the adventure story of a former court magician who had been abandoned. Four years ago, 
        the "Lasting Period," a party of four that had been called "legendary," has gradually 
        spread its name around the world. </p>

    <h3>My Status as an Assassin Obviously Exceeds the Hero's</h3>
    <p>Oda Akira is the kind of guy who people forget is even there. His unassuming nature pays 
        off, though, when his entire class is swept away to a fantasy world, and he slips easily 
        into his new role as a silent assassin. Between his suspiciously high starting stats and 
        too many details that don't fit, Akira is sure something is wrong. But digging into royal 
        secrets is a dangerous game, and when Akira uncovers an evil scheme, he also makes a powerful 
        enemy—the very king who brought him to this world! With the help of the elven spirit medium 
        Amelia, can he find the power to set things right, and get his revenge?</p>

    <h3>Gachiakuta</h3>
    <p>Living in the slums of a wealthy town, Rudo and his foster father Regto try 
        to coexist with the rest of the town's residents, but Rudo despises the wastefulness 
        of the upper class. Ignoring the warnings from those around him, Rudo regularly 
        rummages through the town's garbage in search of anything useful or valuable to save 
        from the "Abyss"—a massive hole where anything considered trash is dumped, including 
        people. Rudo's biological father was one such person, having been thrown into the Abyss 
        after he was accused of murder. One day, after running into a mysterious figure on the 
        way home, Rudo returns to find Regto's dying body on the floor. He is immediately 
        found at the scene by the authorities and is charged with murder. No one believes his 
        claims of innocence, and he is thrown into the Abyss. Instead of dying, however, he finds 
        himself in a strange, foul-smelling place surrounded by monsters made out of trash. When 
        Rudo is attacked by said monsters, he is saved by a man named Enjin, who reveals himself 
        to be a "Cleaner"—someone who uses special weapons called Vital Instruments to combat these 
        creatures. In order to get his revenge on the one who killed Regto, Rudo reluctantly 
        becomes a Cleaner to fight his way back up and out of the Abyss.</p>
