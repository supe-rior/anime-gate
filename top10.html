        <p>One piece</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Summary:Gold Roger was known as the "Pirate King," the strongest 
                and most infamous being to have sailed the Grand Line. The capture 
                and execution of Roger by the World Government brought a change 
                throughout the world. His last words before his death revealed the 
                existence of the greatest treasure in the world, One Piece. It was 
                this revelation that brought about the Grand Age of Pirates, men who 
                dreamed of finding One Piece—which promises an unlimited amount of 
                riches and fame—and quite possibly the pinnacle of glory and the title 
                of the Pirate King. Enter Monkey Luffy, a 17-year-old boy who defies 
                your standard definition of a pirate. Rather than the popular persona 
                of a wicked, hardened, toothless pirate ransacking villages for fun, 
                Luffy's reason for being a pirate is one of pure wonder: the thought 
                of an exciting adventure that leads him to intriguing people and ultimately, 
                the promised treasure. Following in the footsteps of his childhood hero, 
                Luffy and his crew travel across the Grand Line, experiencing crazy 
                adventures, unveiling dark mysteries and battling strong enemies, all 
                in order to reach the most coveted of all fortunes—One Piece.</li>

        <p>Vinland Saga</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Summary:Young Thorfinn grew up listening to the stories of old sailors that had 
                traveled the ocean and reached the place of legend, Vinland. It's said to be 
                warm and fertile, a place where there would be no need for fighting—not at all 
                like the frozen village in Iceland where he was born, and certainly not like 
                his current life as a mercenary. War is his home now. Though his father once 
                told him, "You have no enemies, nobody does. There is nobody who it's okay to 
                hurt," as he grew, Thorfinn knew that nothing was further from the truth. 
                The war between England and the Danes grows worse with each passing year. 
                Death has become commonplace, and the viking mercenaries are loving every 
                moment of it. Allying with either side will cause a massive swing in the balance 
                of power, and the vikings are happy to make names for themselves and take any 
                spoils they earn along the way. Among the chaos, Thorfinn must take his revenge 
                and kill Askeladd, the man who murdered his father. The only paradise for the 
                vikings, it seems, is the era of war and death that rages on.</li>

        <p>Horimiya</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Summary:On the surface, the thought of Kyouko Hori and Izumi Miyamura getting along 
                would be the last thing in people's minds. After all, Hori has a perfect combination 
                of beauty and brains, while Miyamura appears meek and distant to his fellow classmates. 
                However, a fateful meeting between the two lays both of their hidden selves bare. 
                Even though she is popular at school, Hori has little time to socialize with her friends 
                due to housework. On the other hand, Miyamura lives under the noses of his peers, his 
                body bearing secret tattoos and piercings that make him look like a gentle delinquent. 
                Having opposite personalities yet sharing odd similarities, the two quickly become 
                friends and often spend time together in Hori's home. As they both emerge from their 
                shells, they share with each other a side of themselves concealed from the outside world.</li>

        <p>Frieren: Beyond Journey's End</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Summary:During their decade-long quest to defeat the Demon King, the members of the hero's 
                party—Himmel himself, the priest Heiter, the dwarf warrior Eisen, and the elven mage Frieren—forge 
                bonds through adventures and battles, creating unforgettable precious memories for most of them. 
                However, the time that Frieren spends with her comrades is equivalent to merely a fraction of 
                her life, which has lasted over a thousand years. When the party disbands after their victory, 
                Frieren casually returns to her "usual" routine of collecting spells across the continent. Due 
                to her different sense of time, she seemingly holds no strong feelings toward the experiences 
                she went through. As the years pass, Frieren gradually realizes how her days in the hero's party 
                truly impacted her. Witnessing the deaths of two of her former companions, Frieren begins to 
                regret having taken their presence for granted; she vows to better understand humans and create 
                real personal connections. Although the story of that once memorable journey has long ended, a 
                new tale is about to begin. </li>

            <li>Summary:Inspired after watching a volleyball ace nicknamed "Little Giant" in action, 
                small-statured Shouyou Hinata revives the volleyball club at his middle school. The 
                newly-formed team even makes it to a tournament; however, their first match turns out 
                to be their last when they are brutally squashed by the "King of the Court," Tobio 
                Kageyama. Hinata vows to surpass Kageyama, and so after graduating from middle school, 
                he joins Karasuno High School's volleyball team—only to find that his sworn rival, 
                Kageyama, is now his teammate. Thanks to his short height, Hinata struggles to find 
                his role on the team, even with his superior jumping power. Surprisingly, Kageyama has 
                his own problems that only Hinata can help with, and learning to work together appears 
                to be the only way for the team to be successful. Based on Haruichi Furudate's popular 
                shounen manga of the same name, Haikyuu!! is an exhilarating and emotional sports 
                comedy following two determined athletes as they attempt to patch a heated rivalry 
                in order to make their high school volleyball team the best in Japan. </li>

            <li>Summary:The Republic of San Magnolia. For a long time, this country has been besieged 
                by its neighbor, the Giadian Empire, which created a series of unmanned drones called 
                the Legion. After years of painstaking research, the Republic finally developed 
                autonomous drones of their own, turning the one-sided struggle into a war without 
                casualties—or at least, that's what the government claims. In truth, there is no such 
                thing as a bloodless war. Beyond the fortified walls protecting the eighty-five 
                Republic territories lies the "nonexistent" Eighty-Sixth Sector. The young men and 
                women of this forsaken land are branded the Eighty-Six and, stripped of their humanity, 
                pilot the "unmanned" weapons into battle... Shinn directs the actions of a detachment 
                of young Eighty-Sixers while on the battlefield. Lena is a "handler" who commands the 
                detachment from the remote rear with the help of special communication. The farewell 
                story of the severe and sad struggle of these two begins!</li>

                to his bullies. Ken misunderstands her intentions, believing he has made a new

                 then that he meets a Soul Reaper named Rukia Kuchiki, who gets injured while

                are polar opposites. With its prestigious history, Kikyo is attended by 
                noble young ladies from distinguished families, while Chidori is infamously

                customer returns to apologize to Rintarou, introducing herself as the cheerful 
                Kaoruko Waguri. After spending time with Kaoruko, Rintarou appreciates that

                relationship will challenge the social expectations and dynamics around them. </li>
